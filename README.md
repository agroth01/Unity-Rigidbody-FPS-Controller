# Better FPS Controller

## What is this?
Better FPS Controller is my response to the disturbing lack of quality free FPS controllers for Unity available. Most controllers you can find for free online are either:
* Outdated
* Terrible quality
* Not extendable

My solution was to create my own fps controller that has a modular design, clean commented code with good practices and is easily extendable. It will also remain free forever to hopefully help and inspire game developers to make better games.

## Why use this controller?
### Modular
No more do you have to see another "PlayerController.cs" at 2000+ lines of code. Better FPS Controller is built to be modular, where script are built to be independant of eachother and can be modified, added and removed as needed. This also makes it easier to understand and debug.

### Clean code
To make this controller as valuable of a resource to the community as possible, I wanted to make sure that the code is cleanly written and well commented so that others can learn how it works, how to extend it and how you can make your own custom controller.

### Extendable
A problem I have had with controllers in the past, especially free ones is the freedom to take the already existing code and build on top of it. This controller was built with exactly that in mind, providing various ways to extend on this controller to make it fit your game. There is even included multiple examples on how to implement various mechanics, such as a jetpack, dash ability and a teleport ability.

## Main features
* Great customizable movement
* Smooth camera controller with utilities
* Footsteps and custom surface properties
* Documentation and getting started guide
* Prefabs for "plug and play" integration

## Installation
You can download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/agroth01/Better-FPS-Controller/releases) in the form of a .unitypackage file. Once downloaded, either drag the file into your editor or double click it to import.

Alternatively, if you like to make things more difficult for youself, you can download the source code and drag the folder inside "assets" into your asset folder.

## Contributions, bug reports and support
If you feel like you want to contribute to the project, feel free to fork and create a pull request. I am however trying to be very strict with keeping programming style and architecture consistent in this project, so therefore I will keep a high standard for accepting.

If you find any bugs or other problems with the controller, please make a new issue here on Github. Thank you!

Finally, if you want to show support for the development of this, here are some of the ways to do so! I want to make it *very* clear that none of these are required what so ever, but all support is appreciated!
* Create some great games for the indie community.
* Share this github page with others.
* Provide my information in the credits of what you make.
* Say "Thank you Alex" three times into a mirror at 12am while in the complete dark and alone (I will appear in the mirror to thank you in person)
* [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/HP3Byv4s7H) here. I once again want to make it clear that this is very much not mandatory.

## Disclaimer
As I am providing this for free, I cannot guarantee consistent updates, fixes and support. If you want all of this, there are a lot of great paid options for serious projects.
