# Unity-Rigidbody-FPS-Controller
## What is this?
This is my side project that I am working on to create a free high quality rigidbody based FPS controller for Unity engine. The vision is to create a modular, easy to use,
cleanly written FPS controller that is widely available to the public. Hopefully, this will be a good basis for people looking to kickstart their new game idea.

## Uses
### Prototyping
If you are looking for a quick and easy way to test out game ideas without having to spend hours creating a character controller, this will be perfect for you. It includes
various premade setups for frictionless "plug and play" integrations into your existing project. Focus on what is important for your game.

### Controller base
From the start, this controller was made from the ground up to be easily modifyable and extendable. The controller is designed to be modular with great flexibility to be built
upon with events. There are multiple premade modules that can be added, removed and tweaked to build the perfect controller for your game.

### Learning
All code is well documented, organized and commented in order to provide complete transparency and clarity how everything works together and why things does what it does. This
is not only to make it easy to modify, but also to make it easier for less experienced developers understand and learn from. Ideally you can learn some tecniques when creating
your own controllers.

## Features
### Core features
* Modular design. Reduce code bloat by only using the code you need.
* Smooth camera controller. No more jitter!
* Well documented. You will never be confused about what the purpose of something is.

### Main modules
* Movement
* Footsteps
* Headbobbing
* Crouching
* Jumping
* Sprinting
* Camera utilities

### Planned
* Custom surface properties
* Custom surface audio
* "Plug and play" prefabs

# Contributions
If you want to contribute to this project, please feel free to fork this project and create pull requests. I will however be very strict with accepting, in order to preserve 
coding style and structure.

For any bugs or other issues that you might encounter, you can either create an issue here on Github, or contact me directly via Discord.

# Support
Finally, if you want to support the development of this project without contributing to the code, here are some of the ways you can do so. I want to make it very clear that
none of this is mandatory in order to use this controller, but very appreciated!
* Create some great games for the community (please share with me if you do!)
* Share this project with others
* Add me in the credits of your project
* Say "Thank you Alex" into a mirror at 12am while completely alone. I will personally appear in the mirror and thank you.
* [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/HP3Byv4s7H) here. I once again want to make it clear that this is very much not mandatory.
